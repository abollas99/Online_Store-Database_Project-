# database_project
This Project was set in place to allow us to use the SQL and PHP 
knowledge we have learned thus far in a realistic situation. 
The Goal was to create a page that allows to check the inventory 
of a store and place online orders. We were also assigned to allow 
the user to change the order or cancel it.


This code will not function without dbconfig.php which holds 
the login for our schools database. For obvious reasons I did
not include that file in this repository.
